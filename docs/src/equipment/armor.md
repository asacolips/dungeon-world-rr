# Armor

Armor is heavy, difficult to wear and is damned uncomfortable. Some classes
are better trained to ignore these drawbacks, but anyone can strap on a suit
of armor and enjoy the benefits it grants.

## Armor Tags

Armor, like weapons, has tags. Some are purely descriptive but the ones below
have some mechanical effect on the player wearing them

- _n Armor_: It protects you from harm and absorbs damage. When you take damage, subtract your armor from the total. If you have more than one item with _n Armor_, only the highest value counts.
- _+n Armor_: It protects you and stacks with other armor. Add its value to your total armor.
- _Clumsy_: Itâ€™s tough to move around with. -1 ongoing while using it. This penalty is cumulative.
