# Equipment

The musty tombs and forgotten treasure troves of the world are filled with
useful items. The fighter can find a sharp new sword or the thief might
stumble across a deadly poison. Most items are mundane—not magical or
intrinsically unique in any way. Any item that is magical or one-of-a-kind is
not mundane for the purposes of moves. The fighter’s signature weapon is never
mundane.

Each piece of equipment will have a number of tags. These will tell you
something about how the equipment affects the character using it \(like
+Armor\) or suggest something about the way it is used \(like the Range
tags\). Like everything else in Dungeon World, these guide the fiction you’re
creating in play. If a weapon is awkward, it might mean that you’re more
likely to drop it when you fail that hack and slash roll.

By no means is this an exhaustive list—feel free to create your own tags.
