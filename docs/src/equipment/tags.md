# General Equipment Tags

These are general tags that can apply to just about any piece of gear. You’ll
see them on armor, weapons or general adventuring tools.

- _Applied_: It’s only useful when carefully applied to a person or to something they eat or drink.
- _Awkward_: It’s unwieldy and tough to use.
- _+Bonus_: It modifies your effectiveness in a specified situation. It might be “+1 forward to spout lore” or “-1 ongoing to hack and slash.”
- _n coins_: How much it costs to buy, normally. If the cost includes “-Charisma” a little negotiation subtracts the haggler’s Charisma score \(not modifier\) from the price.
- _Dangerous_: It’s easy to get in trouble with it. If you interact with it without proper precautions the GM may freely invoke the consequences of your foolish actions.
- _Ration_: It’s edible, more or less.
- _Requires_: It’s only useful to certain people. If you don’t meet the requirements it works poorly, if at all.
- _Slow_: It takes minutes or more to use.
- _Touch_: It’s used by touching it to the target’s skin.
- _Two-handed_: It takes two hands to use it effectively.
- _n weight_: Count the listed amount against your load. Something with no listed weight isn’t designed to be carried. 100 coins in standard denominations is 1 weight. The same value in gems or fine art may be lighter or heavier.
- _Worn_: To use it, you have to be wearing it.
- _n Uses_: It can only be used _n_ times.
