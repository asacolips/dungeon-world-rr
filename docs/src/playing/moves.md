# Using Moves

This chapter contains the moves that are available to all characters. These
moves fall into two categories: basic and special.

Basic moves are the bread and butter of the adventurer’s life. They cover
situations likely to come up in fights, tense negotiations, and dangerous
areas.

Special moves come up a little more rarely. They cover things like gaining a
level, taking a long journey, or returning to town between adventures.

All player characters have all the basic and special moves. Each player
character will also have some moves from their class—we’ll get to those later.

Each move is presented here starting with its name, then the rules of the
move. Some are also accompanied by a quick discussion of how to use the move
and some examples of the move being used in play.
